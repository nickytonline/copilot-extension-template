# A Template for Your First Copilot Extension

This is a template for creating your first Copilot extension. It's a simple Node.js app that uses Hono.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
open http://localhost:3000
```

Use tunneling to expose your localhost to the internet via [VS Code's Port forwarding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/port-forwarding), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), or similar.

You'll need to create a GitHub app for the Copilot extension to work and use the URL from the from the tunneling above in your GitHub app configuration.
